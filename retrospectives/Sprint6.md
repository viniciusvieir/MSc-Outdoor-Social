| **Sad**  | Planning left something to be desired |               | It was slow because of errors                 | Built recommendation model did not perform as expected                                       |
| **Glad** |                                       |               | Some important features were added to the app | Problem solving on the recommendation model was effective and we have started remodelling it |

### Action items:

- Better planning should be done involving all group members. Members should be proactive when receiving tasks and complete them on time so we can move quick.
