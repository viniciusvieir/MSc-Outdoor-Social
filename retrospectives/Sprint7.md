| **Mad**  | Could have been better                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                     | Bugs were difficult to solve.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Sad**  | Too much stuff, the scope could have been less.                                                                                                                                                                              | Imbalance in the work distribution                                                                                                                                            | **1.** Few functionalities of the application should have be completed already; **2.** We couldn't complete all tasks, some were dragged to the next sprint | **1.** Took time to understand how to create restapi; **2.** Couldn't understand how to evaluate Recommendation system; **3.** Still, slightly uncomfortable with Redux.                                               |
| **Glad** | **1.** Was much better than compared to all Sprints; **2.** Good Planning this Sprint; **3.** In my opinion, the planning on this sprint made it easier to focus on what was a priority and what we should deliver on the scrum meetings | **1.** Teamwork was good. Want to continue the same in the coming sprints; **2.** Team work was really good with some of the team members, a lot of efford can be seen in some of us. | **1.** We completed more tasks in this Sprint, thus increased no. of story points; **2.** Although did not finish all the planned tasks, achieved a lot     | **1.** Finished ML model; **2.** Got way to proceed after talking to mentors and implemented full functionality of Recommendation system; **3.** Innate decoupling of React made implementing toggle feature a breeze. |

### Action items:

- Not all team members agree with the planning, while some think it was good some think it could have been better. To solve this we will have an open discussion to what was good and what was bad so we can improve it. Perhaps do a SWOT or PNI analysis.
- Next sprint we will balance the amount of work in a better shape so some of us gets just enough work only.
