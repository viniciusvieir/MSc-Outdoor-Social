| **Mad**  | Planning lacked equal contribution of all the team members; Meeting times were too long.  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | As there was a lot of setting up to be done, productivity was affected and there was a feeling that not much progress was accomplished. | People from different domains in the team found it difficult to cope up with the terminologies and concepts of the opposing ends. |
| **Sad**  | Planning of sprint, one could have been better. Teamwork had some friction to begin with. | Meeting face to face instead of online could have been better for the team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                         | The learning curve of the technology chosen is a risk factor but cannot be changed as it meets all our requirements.              |
| **Glad** | Planning and brainstorming every step and all the possible challenges along the way.      | Teamwork was good, most people from the group have attended the meetings and contributed to the sprint. There was a good idea of what most people were doing and who was responsible for what. Some teammates are still catching on with the work; The team performed well in teams of producing innovative ideas and sharing their experiences and knowledge. | Team members feel that they gained bits of knowledge from others and helped increase their own productivity.                            | The team was excited to learn cutting edge technologies.                                                                          |

### Improvements for the next sprint

- Keeping calls short.
- We plan to have pair programming sessions to improve team working and understanding of the technologies.

### Thing we want to keep on next sprint

- The team is fully committed to this project and we want to keep it that way.
- Breaking down complex use cases and brainstorming possible solutions with the team is working well and we want to keep that channel open.
- Applying problem solving techniques for resolving team conflicts is working well.
