# Sprint 3

|  | **Planning** | **Team Work** | **Productivity** | **Technology** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mad** | Standup calls are not starting on time because few team members join late. |  |  |  |
| **Sad** |  | Team could be more effective if we had physical meetings to understand few things in a better way. | Some issues took longer than expected. | Sometimes it consumes a lot of time for a small issue as technology is new. |
| **Glad** | With effective timeline and charts, we make our team workflow and handovers run smoothly. | Great collaboration with team members. Great teamwork with effective communication, time management, solving problems, listening to others, and creating an effective learning platform for one another. | Efficiency and level of performance increased significantly by working on sprints. And it was improved with continuous feedback from Teammates. | Absolutely amazing working with React-Native giving an interesting experience and adding extra key skills to career with some extra efforts. |
