| **Mad**  |                                                                                           |                    | Correcting image and formatting location messed up data files and took a long time to rearrange it.                                                                                 | 1. Simple tasks are needed to perform in a complex manner. There is a definate learning curve for react-native-redux. Free tier of the server is giving issues. 2. We had issues with MongoDB taking a lot of RAM on our server, getting the server down |
| **Sad**  | Planning could have accommodated the risk factor that happend during the sprint (server). |                    | roductivity was affected because of server issues.                                                                                                                                  | Bit struggling with mongo DB                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Glad** | 1. Everyone accomplished their tasks. 2. Planning was good during the sprint.             | Good communication | 1. Though few tasks took long, other tasks were finished. 2. A lot of things got done but still can be improved. 3. Some core functionalities were accomplished during this sprint. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
